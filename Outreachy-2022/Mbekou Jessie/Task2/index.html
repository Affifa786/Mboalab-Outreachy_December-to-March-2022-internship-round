                        MboaLab is an open and collaborative space located in the village of Mefou-Assi, Yaoundé, Cameroon. The word “Mboa” has different meanings in native Cameroonian languages: 
                        in Matakam, it means “new”; in Ewondo, it means “unique”; in Duala, it means “village”. Literally translated, MboaLab is a unifying village dedicated to creation; even better, 
                        it is a laboratory for social innovation, community education, collaboration and mediation at the service of the community.

                        it emerge from the communities themselves; this is what ensures its relevance and sustainability. In other words, 
                        sustainable local development needs to be thought by and for the members of a given community. </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">To do so, it is important to break the unenthusiastic spirit that exists among many Cameroonians, by training healthy, 
                        educated citizens capable of critical thinking on issues related to their immediate environment. 
                        By choosing education and health as priority axes, associated with its role as a mediator between Science-Technologies-Societies; 
                        we can say clearly that Mboalab could be a powerful catalyst for local sustainable development.</p>

                    <h6 class="text-secondary">Context</h6>
                    <p>Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. 
                        It is usually spread through contaminated food or water. Once Salmonella Typhi bacteria are eaten or drunk, 
                        they multiply and spread into the bloodstream.<br>
                        Urbanization and climate change have the potential to increase the global burden of typhoid. In addition, increasing 
                        resistance to antibiotic treatment is making it easier for typhoid to spread through overcrowded 
                        populations in cities and inadequate and/or flooded water and sanitation systems.<br>
                        Typhoid or Enteric fever is one of the infectious human diseases in Cameroon and Africa. 
                        Outbreaks of typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi remains a serious health problem worldwide. 
                        There are a number of tests available presently, from molecular to immunological and biochemical to microbiological. 
                        Some well-known and conventional Method of Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever are :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Microbiological cultures</strong>
                            <p>The isolation of the causative organism, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi), is 
                                the gold standard for the diagnosis (WHO, 2018). Body fluids like blood, bone marrow, stool, urine, rose spots, 
                                gastric and intestinal secretions may be cultured. Blood culture gives a definitive diagnosis. 
                                But, the use of bacteriological cultures for the diagnosis of typhoid 
                                infection is cost-intensive and technically difficult, hence the need for other diagnostic tests.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Antibody detection tests</strong>
                            <p>These are rapid serologic tests designed for early and easy point-of-care use.  
                                The Widal Test is based on the measurement of antibodies (agglutinins) against somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens 
                                of Salmonella typhi in the sera of patients. Widely used in many developing countries because of its low cost, 
                                Widal test is limited by lack of standardized methods of assay and misinterpretation of results. This has led to the overestimation of the number 
                                of patients presenting with acute febrile illnesses diagnosed with Typhoid fever. A systematic review by Mengist 
                                and Tilahun (2017) revealed poor reliability, low sensitivity and specificity of the Widal test.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, misdiagnosis is usually experienced since most health care facilities use only Widal test without confirmation of 
                        results with a second test method. In addition, the diagnosis of Typhoid involves several levels of uncertainties. 
                        Patients cannot tell exactly how they feel, doctors and nurses cannot tell exactly what they observe.</p>

                    <h6 class="text-secondary mt-5">Opportunities and solution</h6>
                    <p>Augmented intelligence makes more sense than artificial intelligence, especially in tropical diseases such as Typhoid. 
                        This is because it highlights the enhanced capabilities of a human when augmented with the right tools and technologies.
                        In a sensitive industry such as healthcare, human intelligence cannot be replaced.  
                        Augmented intelligence specifies systems that augment human intelligence rather than attempt to replace them. 
                        Combining AI systems with an irreplaceable human clinician can advance better diagnosis.</p>
                    <p>We propose to use the microcultures test with the blood which seems to be the best accepted by the laboratory technicians. 
                        We will use CNNs as algorithms on the collected images to train the algorithm. Everything will depend on the volume of images we have, 
                        if we have few we will use transfer learning to automate the test of microbiological cultures .As we saw above this test is reliable 
                        at 61% and to reinforce the reliability of this test we will use the second algorithm which is a fast decision tree learner. 
                        This algorithm based on 18 symptoma variables will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease.

            <p>With this main challenge stated above (that is: availability of local and high quality open data), we ought to seek for high quality 
                tools to help collect reliable and accurate data for our project.<br>
                The proposed tool for our collection of data is JotForm (<a href="https://www.jotform.com/" target="_blank">https://www.jotform.com/</a>), 
                a powerful online application that allows anyone to quickly create custom online forms.
                Using Jotform, you can create and publish forms, integrate them into your site, collect data from your users and 
                receive responses by email. This app allows users to collect various types of data, such as voice recordings, 
                barcodes, geolocations and electronic signatures and then build, view, access, sort, fill out, 
                share, and organise all this data in a single place. It also allows payment collection.
                </p>
            <p>JotForm is a web-based app, also available as Jotform Mobile for both Android and IOS devices. 
                Jotform Mobile Form lets you work offline so you can collect data on the go. Once you’re back online, 
                Jotform will sync your data automatically for an uninterrupted experience. It’s a great solution for field workers 
                conducting field research without internet access as it allows submissions to be done even offline. </p>

                </div>
                <p>The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. 
                    The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. 
                    Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of values—what we call "the open source way." 
                    Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, 
                    rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.</p>
                <p>For jobs seekers, 86% of tech professionals say 
                    open source has advanced their careers. Open source will help you:</p>

                    is a paid, remote internship program whose goal is to increase diversity in open source. Outreachy supports people from groups underrepresented in tech. 
                    It also helps newcomers to free software and open source make their first contributions and expressly invites applications from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Women (cis & trans), trans men, and genderqueer people</li>

                        American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, 
                        Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander</li>
                    <li>Anyone who faces systematic bias or

                        country</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Outreachy provides internships to work open source. People apply from all around the world. 
                    Interns work remotely, and are not required to move. Interns are paid a stipend of $6,000 USD for the three month internship.<br>
                    Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, 
                    user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, or data science. Interns often find employment after their 
                    internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.

            <p>Mentors for these projects are willing to work with new Outreachy applicants. 
                Please note that as the round goes on, mentors may close their project to new applicants 
                because they are already working with many applicants. 
                Make sure to start your required contribution as soon as possible!</p>
            <p>Each project mentor is looking for applicants who have different skills. 
                Sometimes a skill is a hard requirement for an applicant to have. Other times, a mentor might prefer an 
                applicant to have a skill, but they would accept an applicant as an intern who didn't have that skill. Some skills are 
                "nice to have" meaning it would be great if applicants have this skill, but the mentor doesn't have a strong preference.</p>

                    <p>Your final application will ask you to fill out a timeline for the internship project. 
                        If you have trouble with this, or a mentor tells you they don't want you to fill out the timeline, you should simply 
                        note any full-time commitments you'll have during the internship period that will impact your work.<br>
                        When filling out the timeline, applicants should look at the internship tasks listed on the project page, and take 
                        into account their full-time commitments to determine what they'll be working on during what part of the internship period.

                    <p>Most projects will require a few weeks of ramp-up, research, and integrating into the community. Try to break 
                        down each big internship task into several smaller tasks, until you have an idea of what you'll be working for each week 
                        of the 13 week internship. All projects will have some tasks where the details will be vague until the time you start the task. 
                        It is fine to provide higher-level descriptions of what you'll be working on.</p>
