# Research
What is the scope of the expected/required:

- Functionalities
- Pages
- Volume

1. Once the list of the essentials above are confirmed upon the feedback of the mentor, design the platform on Figma
2. Discuss and record the feedback of a mentor. Test and update where needed.
3. Build using the agreed platform (Django, Angular, Vue.js or React.js)

# Result
The choice of tool for building an online platform for the project: Angular.

Angular is one of the best choices for building front-end solutions of online platforms. Here is a short lit of the reasons why I've chosen this framework:

1. Effective Cross-Platform Development.
2. High Quality of the Application.
3. Improved Speed and Performance.
4. Faster Development Process.
5. Readable and Testable Code.
6. More Lightweight Web Applications.
7. Efficient Problem-Solving Patterns.
8. Excellent Material Design Library.

This framework is advanced than React.js and Vue.js. That's why it's less common among small projects and used in more practical cases.

The current version provides:

- [x] Design and the extended version of the design migrated to a website
- [x] SPA for an online platform foreseeing a template. Images have been shown in colored shapes. All are replaced once the assets are confirmed in the process of project development
- [x] Responsive layout: Desktop, tablet and mobile versions of the website
