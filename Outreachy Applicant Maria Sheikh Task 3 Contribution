Hi, 
I have utilized google forms as a tool for data collection of typhoid symptoms. 
Questionare is designed based on typhoid symptoms mentioned in following research paper:
Oguntimilehin, Abiodun & Adetunmbi, Adebayo & O.B, Abiola. (2013). 
A Machine Learning Approach to Clinical Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever.
International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology. 02. 671-676.
