#Design a Data Collection Tool

The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be use to collect thyphoid fever clinical data (symptoma variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease).
This will be achieved by taking into account local and context specificties (Language, access to specific resources etc..).

For this task, I choose google forms.For the following reasons:
-It allows for easy online availability
-It allows for easy translation to languages like French or the other 13 African languages.
-Due to a lack of connectivity / technological devices google form can be saved to pdf form and used as printed form.

[Typhoid Diagnostics Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNFwChuyRmQIObgJeJ3Agrt4zVAyBpvrSODUP4fMWuWYfcqQ/viewform?usp=pp_url)

Google form is easy to complete after practitioner acknoweledges that patient has given consent.
