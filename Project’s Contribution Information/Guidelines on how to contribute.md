# How to contribute to the project?

As part of the application process, all applicants must make at least one contribution to be accepted as an intern for this project.

 **_Only applicants who contribute will be eligible to be accepted as interns._**
 
 
We are looking for motivated interns who can work in an inclusive and multidisciplinary environment, to contribute to setting up a local and robust dataset subdivided into two main subsets: the first consisting of images and the second of structured data. The dataset should be open, interoperable and aligned with the Metadata Schema 4.4 https://schema.datacite.org/.

Applicants can contribute to this project through the [project repository](https://github.com/Mboalab/Mboalab-Outreachy_December-to-March-2022-internship-round) on GitHub. 

## Selecting a Task

Lists of newcomer-friendly and advanced tasks can be found in the [Starter Tasks](https://github.com/Mboalab/Mboalab-Outreachy_December-to-March-2022-internship-round/tree/main/Starter%20Tasks) folder in the project repository. 
Applicants are encouraged to select a task based on personal interest, background and skills.

_**Both individual or collective contributions to a particular task are welcomed.**_

## Sending Contributions 

Contributions can be sent after creating a folder highlighting contributor(s) name in the **[Applicant's Contributions]** folder which can be found in each task folder.
- Please get in touch with a mentor to guide you through the process in case of any difficulty.

## Nature of Contributions
The nature of contributions varies greatly according to the selected task. In order to ensure a tailored, inclusive and open contribution process, applicants are encouraged to use the guidelines provided in each task description to propose the best format for their contributions. Participants are therefore welcome and should feel free to propose, innovate and adjust their contributions according to their own understanding. Mentors will always be there to guide and frame received ideas.
