# How to contribute to the project?

As part of the application process, all applicants must make at least one contribution to be accepted as an intern for this project.

 **Only applicants who contribute will be eligible to be accepted as interns.**

We are looking for motivated interns who can work in an inclusive and multidisciplinary environment, to contribute to setting up a local and robust dataset subdivided into two main subsets: the first consisting of images and the second of structured data. The dataset should be open, interoperable and aligned with the Metadata Schema 4.4 https://schema.datacite.org/.

Applicants can contribute to this project through the [project repository](https://github.com/Mboalab/Mboalab-Outreachy_December-to-March-2022-internship-round) on GitHub. Lists of newcomer-friendly and advanced tasks can be found in the [Starter Tasks] folder in the project repository. Applicants are encouraged to select a task based on personal interest, background and skills.
