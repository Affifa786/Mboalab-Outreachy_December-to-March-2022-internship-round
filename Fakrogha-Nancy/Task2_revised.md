### Build an Online Platform for the Project

I have made a few adjustments to the project website, i added  two new sections, __communities__ and __data collection__ to shed more light on our mentors, sponsors and the contributors we accept for this project.
There are a few tutorial clips as well to assist first time users trying to get familiar with our data collection tool, little modifications were also made on the project relevance and objective pages.

Here is the link to the reviewed [website](https://nancyfaks.wixsite.com/my-site)

Thank you.
